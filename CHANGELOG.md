## v1.0.0
### Comments:
- I expect that this initial commit will be a lot to digest compared to future commits. That being said, all of the requirements listed in this version distil down to only 4 categorical requirements: adequately restrictive default file and directory permissions, adequately restrictive permissions on binaries that can create and modify user accounts and passwords, mandatory usage of a hardware security token for root user login, and prohibiting privilege escalation via the '$ sudo' command.
